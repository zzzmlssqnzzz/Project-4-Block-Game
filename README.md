# Project-4-Block-Game
The game board resembles a Mondrian painting, and you can easily pick the color scheme that is most appealing to you. This project is adapted from an assignment created by Diane Horton and David Liu from University of Toronto.

* The game is played on a randomly-generated game board made of squares of four different colors (Yellow, Green, Blue, Red)
* Each player is randomly assigned their own goal to work towards:
    * Either to create the largest connected ”blob” of a given color
    * To put as much of a given color on the outer perimeter as possible.

* There are three kinds of moves a player can do:
    * Rotating a block (clockwise or counterclockwise)
    * Reflecting the block horizontally or vertically (i.e. along the x-axis or the y-axis if you imagine the origin of the axes being place in the center of the block)
    * “Smashing” a block (giving it four brand-new, randomly generated, sub-blocks).

After each move, the player sees their score, determined by how well they have achieved their goal. The game continues for a certain number of turns, and the player with the highest score at the end is the winner.
